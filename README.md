So you are allowed to do anything with this code, but bad stuff... Be sure to use VS( visual studio C++ ) to run this, and also 
this file is only 60 - 75% complete, there are still 1 to 4 functions incomplete, so u should finsih them, and if u decide that you are satisfied with just
three functions... Well, I can't do anything about it... :D
